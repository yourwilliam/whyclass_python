A wood flooring company stores the names of up to 100 customers in a one‑dimensional (1D) array `Customers[]`. A two‑dimensional (2D) array `Quotations[]` stores details of each customer’s quotation:

• length of room (one decimal place)

• width of room (one decimal place)

• area of wood required (rounded up to next whole number)

• choice of wood index (whole number)

• price of wood required in dollars (two decimal places).

The floor measurements (room length and room width) are taken in metres. All floors are rectangles and room measurements must be between 1.5 and 10.0 inclusive.

The index of any customer’s data is the same in both arrays. For example, a customer named in index 4 of Customers\[] corresponds to the data in index 4 of `Quotations[]`

The wood choices available are:

| Index | Wood type | Price per square metre ($) |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| 1     | Laminate  | 29.99                      |
| 2     | Pine      | 39.99                      |
| 3     | Oak       | 54.99                      |

The data are stored in two 1D arrays named `WoodType[]` and `Price[]`. The index of the wood type and price in their arrays share the same index number.

Write a program that meets the following requirements:

* input a new customer’s name, room length and room width
* check that each measurement is valid
* output an error message and require the measurement to be re‑entered until it is valid
* calculate the area of the room by multiplying together the length of the room and the width of the room
* input the choice of wood and find its price per square metre
* calculate the price of the wood needed
* store all data in the relevant array
* output the customer’s quotation to include: the name of the customer, the choice of wood and the calculated price of the wood required
* continue to accept the next customer.

You must use pseudocode or program code and add comments to explain how your code works. You do not need to declare any arrays or variables; you may assume that this has already been done.

You will need to initialise `WoodType[]` and `Price[]`

All inputs and outputs must contain suitable messages.

### Python版初始化代码，练习的时候使用如下的代码

```python

import string
import random

#################################################
# Declare
#################################################

customer_size = 100
customers = []
quotations = []
wood_type = ["Laminate", "Pine", "Oak"]
price = [29.99, 39.99, 54.99]

#################################################
# Initialize Data (not include)
#################################################

for customer_index in range(customer_size):
    customers.append(''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for name_letter_index in range(6)))
    quation_item = [0.0, 0.0, 0, 0, 0.0]
    quotations.append(quation_item)

print(customers)
print(quotations)
